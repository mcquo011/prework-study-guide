# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide was created for students preparing for Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this study guide is to store notes on the basics of HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. This project was built in order to give a new bootcamp student experience creating a simple webpage. Bootcamp students now have a webpage where they can access notes on what they've learned during the prework, so they can apply this knowledge to the bootcamp course. Through out the process of building this webpage, bootcamp students learned how to create the HTML for the webpage, add CSS, add basic JavaScript functions, and complete the GIT flow with each process.
